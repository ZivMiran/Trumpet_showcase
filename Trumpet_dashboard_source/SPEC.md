# Trumpet — Component Spec

Every visible component, grouped by where it appears. For each: **Looks** (visual
description), **States** (default / hover / active / mobile), and **Content** (what goes
inside).

A note on mobile: Trumpet is a **desktop-first dashboard prototype**. There are no responsive
breakpoints — the layout assumes a wide viewport. The only adaptive behavior is the Revenue
donut's height-based compact mode. "Mobile" notes below say so honestly rather than inventing
breakpoints that don't exist; building responsive variants would be net-new design, not part
of the prototype.

## App Shell

The persistent frame around every page: fixed sidebar on the left, scrollable main column
(header + page content) on the right. Overlays (notification dropdown, notifications modal)
render above everything.

### Sidebar
- **Looks:** Fixed-width (232px) vertical rail on the app canvas. Top: brass-gold Trumpet
  logo mark + "Trumpet" wordmark. Below: a "Workspace" section label, then nav items; an
  "Account" section label, then the Settings nav item; pinned to the bottom, the account
  switcher trigger.
- **States:**
  - Nav item *default* (inactive): muted text, transparent background.
  - Nav item *hover*: surface lightens, text brightens.
  - Nav item *active*: brass-tinted background, gold text/icon — marks the current page.
  - Account trigger *default* vs *open*: open state highlights the trigger and shows the
    popover above it.
  - *Mobile:* no collapsed/hamburger variant — the rail stays fixed.
- **Content:** Logo + wordmark; Workspace nav (Overview, Music, Audience — each an icon +
  label); Account nav (Settings); account switcher trigger showing current account avatar,
  name, and a live "N live now" count with a pulsing dot.

### Account switcher popover
- **Looks:** Floating card anchored above the sidebar trigger, over a click-catching scrim.
  Header row + a list of account rows + divider + add/log-out actions.
- **States:** Open/closed (toggled by the trigger). Each account row: *current* (brass-tinted
  background + check icon) vs *selectable* (transparent, hover-highlight). "Add another
  account" only shows when an unused account exists.
- **Content:** "Accounts" label + total "N live now"; one row per active account (color
  avatar with initials, name, "N live · M monthly", check if current); "Add another account";
  "Log out".

### Header
- **Looks:** Top bar of the main column. Left: page title + subtitle. Center: search box.
  Right: notification bell + Export button.
- **States:**
  - Search box *empty* (placeholder) vs *typing* (shows a results dropdown over a scrim).
  - Bell *default* vs *open* (highlighted while the dropdown is shown); shows a small gold
    dot when there are unread notifications.
  - Export button hover.
  - *Mobile:* fixed three-part layout, no stacking.
- **Content:** Page title + subtitle (per page); search input ("Search releases, songs,
  albums…"); bell with unread dot; "Export" button with download icon.

### Header search results
- **Looks:** Dropdown below the search box listing matching releases; each row is icon +
  title/album + stream count.
- **States:** Shown only while the query is non-empty. *No-results* shows "No matches for
  '…'". Rows hover-highlight.
- **Content:** One row per matched catalog track (note icon, title, album, streams). Clicking
  jumps to that track on the Music page.

### Notification dropdown
- **Looks:** Floating panel anchored under the bell, over a scrim. Header + scrollable list +
  footer.
- **States:** Open/closed. Each row *unread* (faint brass background + trailing gold dot) vs
  *read* (transparent). "N new" pill hides when nothing is unread.
- **Content:** "Notifications" title + "N new" pill + "Mark all read"; rows (note icon, title,
  timestamp, body, unread dot); footer "See all notifications →" (opens the modal).

### Notifications modal
- **Looks:** Centered dialog over a full scrim. Header (title, total count, mark-all, close),
  toolbar (search + filter pills), scrollable list.
- **States:** Open/closed. Filter pills: *active* vs *inactive*. Search filters live. Empty
  state shows "No notifications match your search."
- **Content:** "All notifications" + total count; search input; filter pills (All, Insights,
  Milestones, Account); rows (icon, title, time, body, kind pill, unread dot).

## Overview Page

Vertical stack: pulse insight carousel, KPI ribbon, then a two-column chart row (streams
chart + revenue donut).

  gold-highlighted phrase, and a sub line. Right: "View detail →" and pager dots.

### Streams chart
- **Looks:** Large card. Header: a metric selector button + big value/delta, and a timeframe
  segmented control. Body: y-axis labels, an area+line chart with dashed gridlines, an
  average line with an "Avg" pill, hover crosshair + dot + tooltip, and peak-event markers;
  x-axis labels below. The line animates (draws in) on metric/timeframe change.

    a tooltip.
  - Chart *hover*: crosshair + highlighted dot follow the cursor; tooltip shows value (and
    peak-event detail when near an event marker); tooltip flips above/below to stay in view.

### Revenue donut
- **Looks:** Card with title/subtitle and an SVG donut; center shows a label + value; a legend
  lists each platform with color dot, name, %, and amount.
- **States:**
  - Segment/legend-row *hover*: that segment thickens, others dim; center swaps to the hovered
    platform's label + amount; a small tooltip appears. Legend row highlights.
  - *Compact (height < 470px):* legend is hidden, donut only. (The one real responsive rule.)
- **Content:** "Est. Revenue" + "Last 30 days · by platform"; segments per platform (label,
  %, amount, color); center total.

  up to 4 mover cards. Each card: music icon, title, rank/timeframe sub, a sparkline, and a
